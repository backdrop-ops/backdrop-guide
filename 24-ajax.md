#Drupal AJAX Framework

AJAX is the de facto standard for having the web browser interact with
the server without requiring a full page refresh. The term is an
acronym for Asynchronous Javascript and XML, although it has come to 
be widely used for any partial page refresh interaction. Drupal's 
specific version of it does not rely on XML at all. In earlier versions,
the Drupal version of this was called AHAH, but as a community we chose
to start using standard terminology when Drupal 7 was released.

The primary use case for AJAX in Drupal is within forms.

*TODO: Write the rest of this. For now, see [Ajax Framework](https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes!ajax.inc/group/ajax/7.x)
on the Drupal API site.*
